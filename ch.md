Name: Lodos Colborne

Age: 27

Race: Variant Human

Height: 5'7"

Weight: 143lbs

Background: Forest Dweller (Outlander w/ slight mods)

Alignment: Neutral

Languages: Common, Druidic, Auran, Sylvan. Literacy is poor in all but Druidic. 

Personality Traits:
 - I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.
 - I prize honesty and plainspokeness.
 - I fiercely protect those I trust--beast and man.

Ideal: The natural world is more important than all the constructs of civilization.

Bonds/Hook: Every five nights, you have a strange sequence of apocalyptic dreams.
The world is destroyed by cold, choking fumes, lightning storms,
waves of acid, and horrible fire. Each time, the dream ends with ten evil eyes
glaring at you from the darkness. You feel a strange compulsion to travel to Greenest.
Perhaps the answer to the riddle of your dreams awaits you there.

Flaws:
 - My hatred of the unnatural is unbounded.
 - I am skeptical of the value of gold and silver. 

Feature: Wild home
You can comfortably sleep outdoors in clear weather (you fall asleep easily but sleep lightly)
and can reliably find or create shelter in harsh conditions.
It is easy for you to locate water, food, herbs, animal trails, river crossings,
and natural tools provided they exist in your surroundings.
You remember every type of animal you've seen and can tell two animals of the same species apart.

Backstory: My family was part of a small band of traveling players who performed
for town festivals. One night venturing along a rural route, the caravan came upon a circle of druids conjuring a powerful air elemental. As they watched, the druids lost control of the elemental and it stormed straight for the wagons. The raging elemental tore apart the caravan, but as it swirled over my cradle, the druids managed to regain control. With my family dead and the touch of the elemental plane fresh upon me, the druids decided to take me in and raise me as one of their own. As I learned the ways of the druid, I discovered that the reason the air elemental was conjured that fateful night was to defend against an imminent attack by mind flayers. Knowing this, I cultivated a special fascination with Fey and Elemental creatures so that the next summons would not go awry.
